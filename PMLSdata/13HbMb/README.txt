hemoglobinmyoglobin.mat: Binding curves of two macromolecules for oxygen.
	- hemoglobin:
		Column 1:	concentration in M
		Column 2:	probability to be bound
	- myoglobin:
		Column 1:	concentration in M
		Column 2:	probability to be bound

hemoglobin.csv, myoglobin.csv, hemoglobin.npy, and myoglobin.npy: Same format.

hemoglobinmyoglobin.npz: Same data as hemoglobinmyoglobin.mat.
